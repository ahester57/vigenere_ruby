In this test, I noticed that my machine was bound by memory when doing the 5-letter keys. At 16 GB ram, 12 GB were used the whole time. CPU was only at about 27% the whole time.

The program found the plain-text in about 20 minutes, but took another 30-40 minutes to test the remaining 5-letter keys.

Another observation was that Ruby seemed to struggle garbage collecting everything. After the program said 'Goodbye.", it took another 5-10 minutes just to exit. Watching task manager, the memory usage slowly trended down until it was able to safely close.
